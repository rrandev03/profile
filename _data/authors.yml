    I'm currently a 2nd year Master's in Data Science student at <span style="color: #3b82f6;"><strong>Duke University.</strong></span> 

    ## How did I end up here?
    Interdisciplinary has been a running theme in my personal and professional journey. As a public health student at the <span style="color: #cc6600;"><strong>University of Virginia</strong></span>, I found my initial interest in clinical work and pre-medical studies transformed into a love for analytics and solving real world community health challenges by looking at well-being from a more holistic lens. From here, I started my path towards data science. I was fortunate enough to spend a few years as a Site Reliability Engineer at <span style="color: #ff8800;"><strong>The Home Depot</strong></span>—another fundamentally interdisciplinary role where I honed my technical skills while gaining invaluable experience in GCP and DevOps, and in general a mental framework for building and maintaining reliable systems.

    Outside of academics, I am driven by a genuine interest in exploring diverse cultures and religions. This curiosity about the world enhances my ability to approach data science with a unique and empathetic lens, allowing me to uncover insights that are not only technically sound but also culturally and socially relevant. When I'm not at a desk typing away, you'll probably find me outside exploring nature, reading a classic novel, or roaming around an international grocery store.
